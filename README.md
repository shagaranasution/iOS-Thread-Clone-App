# iOS ThreadClone App  

An iOS mobile app developed with Swift to replicate key features of the Thread app by Meta. This app was created for learning purposes and as a portfolio project to demonstrate proficiency in iOS development using UIKit, Firebase, and SDWebImage.  

## Features  

- **User Authentication:** Register and log in using Firebase Authentication.  
- **Post Threads:** Users can create posts (threads) visible to others.  
- **Explore & Search:** Discover other users and search profiles.  
- **View Posts:** See all users' posts on a feed and access individual user profiles to view their threads.  
- **Profile Management:** Update profile details and view a personalized list of threads in the profile section.  
- **Programmatic UI:** Built using UIKit with Auto Layout constraints for responsive design.  
- **MVVM Design Pattern:** Ensures scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.  

## Tech Stack 

### Core Frameworks and Libraries  
- **UIKit**: For programmatic user interface with Auto Layout.  
- **Firebase**:  
  - `FirebaseAuth` for authentication.  
  - `FirebaseFirestore` & `FirebaseFirestoreSwift` for data persistence.  
  - `FirebaseStorage` for storing profile pictures and other media.
  - [Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs) 
- **SDWebImage**: Efficient image loading and caching.  

## Prerequisites  

### Development Environment  
- **Xcode 13 or later**  
- **Cocoapods** installed for managing dependencies.  

### Minimum Requirements  
- **iOS 14 or later**  

## Getting Started  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shagaranasution/iOS-Thread-Clone-App.git
  cd ThreadClone
  ```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) installed. Then, run:
  ```bash
  pod install
  ```
Open the project using the .xcworkspace file generated by Cocoapods.

### 3. Configure Firebase
This project includes a placeholder `GoogleService-Info.plist`. Replace it with your own `GoogleService-Info.plist` file obtained from the Firebase Console after configuring Firebase for the app. Follow [Firebase Setup Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) for detailed instructions.

### 4. Run the App
In Xcode, select your simulator or physical device and press Cmd + R to build and run the app.

## Disclaimer
This app is intended for educational purposes only and is not a production-ready implementation. Key considerations:

- **Firebase Configuration**: You must configure your own Firebase project to use the app.
- **Limited Features**: The app mimics core functionalities of the Thread app but does not include all features.
